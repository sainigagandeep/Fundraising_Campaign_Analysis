# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstart data to cover the trend
## Overview of Project and Purpose
Louise’s want to launch a fundraising campaign and for that she want to know  how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We have the Kickstarter dataset which has data of different campaingns. I used this data to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
To analyize the data, firstly, I cleaned the data by using various Excel fuctions. For example, I converted the date into correct and readable formate. Then, I color coded the outcomes and percentage funded. I used pivot table and vlookup function to create more crisp and useful data tables and then created the charts to have clear view of the trends.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


 




### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Its very difficult to understand that much data in the starting. But, I follow the steps one by one as explained in the module, and I am able to clean and make it readable. Another challenge I faced is that It took a lot of time as I am new to this. However, after classes and doing this challenge, I learned a lot and now i can create Pivot table, use filters in effective ways and do vlookup. 
## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1- The most number of successful events launched in the month of May,June and July. Therefor,these months are ideal for launching a event.
2- Decemeber is the worst month to launch a event because the probability of success is least in this month. 
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1-The probability of success decreases as Goal amount increases and vica-versa. The Goal amount should be less $15000 to have the probability of success more than the failed.
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data have not sufficent infomation about the common attributes of a successful and failed campaign. 
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 We can create table and draw graph about the outcomes based on the length of the events.
